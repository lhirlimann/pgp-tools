gpg-mailkeys
------------

Given one or more key-ids, gpg-mailkeys mails these keys to their owners. You
use this after you've signed them. By default, the mails contain a standard
text and your name and address as the From (as determined by the sendmail
command).

You can modify how this script behaves by putting a .gpg-mailkeysrc file in
your homedir. An example of this file is provided with this document.
