Caff is not the work of a sole author.  It wouldn't be what it is without the
help of several people.  I'ld like to say thank you to everybody who helped to
make caff better.

- Nick Mathewson
  For suggesting and implementing --no-download and --no-sign.

- And of course everyone who sent comments, suggestions or bug-reports.
