caff  --  CA - fire and forget

caff is a script that helps you in keysigning.  It takes a list of
keyids on the command line, fetches them from a keyserver and calls
GnuPG so that you can sign it.  It then mails each key to all its
email addresses - only including the one UID that we send to in each
mail.


Features:
 * Easy to setup.
 * Attaches only the very UID that we send to in the mail.
 * Prunes the key from all signatures that are not self sigs and
   not done by you, thereby greatly reducing the size of mails.
 * Sends the mail encrypted if possible, will warn before sending
   unencrypted mail (sign only keys)
 * Creates proper PGP MIME messages.
 * Uses separate GNUPGHOME for all its operations.

Caveats:
 * Requires a gpg patch for now, until 2 bugs are fixed:
     http://bugs.debian.org/252917    gnupg: --with-colons and --edit delsigs
     http://bugs.debian.org/254072    gpg should flush stdout before prompting in --edit

Discussion:

Since we do not upload the new signatures, or import them into our
main keyring, the signature only gets public if:
 - the email address is valid
 - the person reading the email can decrypt the mail (if it was sent
   encrypted).

Therefore we achieve the same level of security as common Challenge
Repsonse systems like CABot, without all the extra hassle of those
systems.
