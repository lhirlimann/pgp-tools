.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gpgparticipants
is targeted at organisers of a keysigning party that uses the
Zimmermann-Sassaman key-signing protocol.

It creates a file with all the keys from a list of participators in your
keysigning party. You give it a list with key ID's and some general variables,
and it will generate a file you can publish. You publish this list;
participants will download and print this file to take with them to the party.
