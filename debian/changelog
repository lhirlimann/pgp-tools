      libterm-readkey-perl, libclass-methodmaker-perl
  * Added wipe as suggested package (useful with gpgdir).

  [ Thijs Kinkhorst ]
  * Checked for policy 3.8.0, no changes.
  * caff: Fix pod syntax problems (Closes: #485653).
  * gpg-key2ps: no longer waste paper on the subkey information by

    option to enable if you want it.
  * Remove obsolete transitional packages sig2dot, springgraph.

  [ Christoph Berg ]
  * Import keyanalyze into signing-party. Thanks to Matthew Wilcox for the
    permission. Provide a transitional package.

      (Closes: #309101)
    + Update config.{sub,guess}. (Closes: #365148)
    + Add patch by Stephan Beyer to improve process_keys' input parsing,
      remedying the need of weird grep and sed commands. (Closes: #370571)
    + Add -h option to keyanalyze, and update manpage. (Closes: #370570)
  * Put examples in .../examples/$prog, not the other way round.

  * caff: always update the user's key from their GnuPG home, to adequately
    cope with changed keys (Closes: #462897).

     + use Getopt::Long, general code cleanup.
