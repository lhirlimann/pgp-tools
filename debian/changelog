signing-party (0.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merging signing-party with pgp-tools, now contains caff
    and gpgsigs as well.
  * Update gpg-mailkeys man page to list environment vars
    introduced in 0.3.0 (Closes: #310418).
  * gpg-key2ps: be a bit more liberal w.r.t. subkeys, so some
    don't break the PS output (Closes: #311990).
