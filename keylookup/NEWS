Release notes for keylookup 2005-08-16
 * Make keylookup use gpg --search instead of querying the
   keyserver directly.

Release notes for keylookup 2.2 (2002-09-24)
 * Some keyservers have started putting the key type (DSA or RSA)
   in their replies to searches. Keylookup now handles that.
 * Untaint keyIDs before passing them to GnuPG as passing tainted
   argumentes in exec() is now deprecated.
   (closes: DebianBug #161392)

Release notes for keylookup 2.1 (2002-06-17)
 * Support newstyle gnupg config file (honor-proxy);
   (closes: SavannahBug #523)
 * Rewrote TODO in English; (closes: DebianBug #120861).
