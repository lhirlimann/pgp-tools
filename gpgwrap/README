  [2] SHORT BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
  ============================


To build gpgwrap a simple 'make' should be enough. You may build gpgwrap with
dietlibc, just set and export the environment variable DIET to the location
of your 'diet' binary and run 'make'. Dietlibc is a libc that is optimized
for small size, look at http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/ for more.
