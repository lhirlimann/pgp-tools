OpenPGP key analysis

keyanalyze takes a PGP/GnuPG public key ring and analyses the relationships
between the keys in it.  It produces output suitable for placing on a web
site showing which keys have signed which other keys.  Its aim is to
stimulate awareness of keysigning and help people notice gaps in the Web of
Trust that could easily be filled.

More documentation later on I hope. For now:

make
./analyze.sh path/to/pubring.pgp

Output is stored in ./output/ - Be prepared. There is a lot of it.
I'd suggest having at least 1GB free if you're processing from the
the 'full' keyring. (1 million keys or more)

Modify the analyze.sh file to meet your needs if necessary.
