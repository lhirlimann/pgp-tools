OpenPGP Random Art
------------------

keyart takes a single exported public key file as an argument, and prints
out its random visualization ASCII art based on the public key fingerprint.
Please see 'doc/drunken-bishop.txt' for more information about the algorithm
and changes compared to OpenSSH keys.

Usage
-----

The exported public key file can be in binary or ASCII armor format. To
export the desired key:

    $ gpg --output /tmp/0x808606060F.pgp --export 0x8086060F

Then to produce the random art for that key:

    $ keyart /tmp/0x8086060F.pgp
