OpenPGP Random Art
------------------

keyart takes any argument that can uniquely identify a key (name, email
address, short key ID, long key ID, fingerprint, etc), and prints out its
random visualization ASCII art based on the public key fingerprint. Please see
'doc/drunken-bishop.txt' for more information about the algorithm and changes
compared to OpenSSH keys.

Usage
-----

keyart can take a publicly exported GPG key or keyring to draw the art, or it
can use an identifier to uniquely identify a key in your public keyring, such as
an email address, short key ID, long key ID or key fingerprint.

To produce the random art for a key:

    $ keyart 0x8086060F
    +----[DSA 1024]-----+
