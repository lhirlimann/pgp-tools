.SH NAME
.B keyart
\- Create ASCII art of an OpenPGP key.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B keyart
[-a|--ansi] -i|--id KEYID [KEYID ...]
.br
.B keyart
[-a|--ansi] -f|--file FILE [FILE ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B keyart
creates an ASCII art representation of a public OpenPGP key. The art is an
implementation of the Drunken Bishop by Dirk Loss. Documentation about the
algorithm can be found /usr/share/doc/keyart/, or as appropriate for your
distribution.

.B keyart
supports printing the ASCII art in both plain text (default) and ANSI
color. ANSI color uses a "heat map", where cold (blue) represents squares in
the room the drunk bishop has rarely visited, and hot (red) represents squares
in the room the drunk bishop has frequently visited. There is a 1:1 ratio of
color to printed character.
