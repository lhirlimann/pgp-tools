Reimplement the "Drunken Bishop" walk as implemented by OpenSSH. We use a
larger field size for GnuPG due to SHA1 fingerprint sizes (11x19).

See http://www.dirk-loss.de/sshvis/drunken_bishop.pdf for the algorithm
and security analysis for OpenSSH.

The field is as defined:

             111111111
   0123456789012345678

  y
(row)

Each position on the board can be represented by its cartesian
coordinates (x,y). We can assign each positition a numerical value by
using the equation:

  pos = x + 19y

Each position on the board contains an ASCII character the represents the
frequency of visits by the bishop. A blank position has not been visited.
The more the bishop has visited a square, the heavier or more dense the
ASCII character should be. From light -> dark, the following scale should
be used:

  " .'`^",:;Il!i><~+_-?][}{1)(|\/tfjrxnuvczXYUJCLQ0OZmwqpdbkhao*#MW&8%B@$"

See the table below (note, this does not necessarily follow OpenSSH):

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--++--+--+
|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18||19|20|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--++--+--+
| |.|^|:|l|i|?|{|f|x|X |Z |# |M |W |& |8 |% |@ ||S |E |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--++--+--+

'S' and 'E' are special characters that represent the starting and ending
location of the bishop respectively. 'S' always starts at coordinates
(9,5), which is position 104, the center of the board.

Movement is defined by taking the fingerprint, and coverting each
character to its binary value. For exmaple, the fingerprint:

  E041 3539 273A 6534 A3E1  9259 22EE E048 8086 060F

has the binary values of:

  1110000001000001 0011010100111001 0010011100101010 0110010100110100
  1010001111100001 1001001001011001 0010001011101110 1110000001001000
  1000000010000110 0000011000001111

In OpenSSH, the movement is found using bit-pairs at a time, left to
right, least significant bit to most sifginifant bit. In this
implementation for OpenPGP, the same rule applies. So:

              +-----+-----++-----+-----++-----++-----+-----++-----+-----+
Fingerprint:  |  E  |  0  ||  4  |  1  || ... ||  0  |  6  ||  0  |  F  |
              +--+--+--+--++--+--+--+--++-----++--+--+--+--++--+--+--+--+
   Bit-pair:  |11|10|00|00||01|00|00|01|| ... ||00|00|01|10||00|00|11|11|
              +--+--+--+--++--+--+--+--++-----++--+--+--+--++--+--+--+--+
       Step:  |4 |3 |2 |1 ||8 |7 |6 |5 || ... ||76|75|74|73||80|79|78|77|
              +--+--+--+--++--+--+--+--++-----++--+--+--+--++--+--+--+--+

The direction of our drunken bishop follows standard Chess rules for the
bishop piece, moving only on the diagnal across the beard, which is
defined as follows:

  +------+-----+
  | Pair | Dir |
  +------+-----+       N
  |  00  | NW  |       ^
  +------+-----+       |
  |  01  | NE  |  W <--+--> E
  +------+-----+       |
  |  10  | SW  |       v
  +------+-----+       S
  |  11  | SE  |
  +------+-----+

The bishop starts in the center of the board at position 104. So, each
possible move would place him on the following positions on the board,
after the first move:

  +------+-----+------+
  | Pair | Pos | Diff |
  +------+-----+------+
  |  00  | 84  | -20  |
  +------+-----+------+
  |  01  | 86  | -18  |
  +------+-----+------+
  |  10  | 122 | +18  |
  +------+-----+------+
  |  11  | 124 | +20  |
  +------+-----+------+

We must cleanly handle how the bishop behaves when he reaches the edge of
the board, or a corner. We'll define the types of positions as follows:

  +-------------------+
  |aTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTb|
  |LMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMR|   a = NW corner
  |LMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMR|   b = NE corner
  |LMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMR|   c = SW corner
  |LMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMR|   d = SE corner
  |LMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMR|   T = Top edge
  |LMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMR|   B = Bottom edge
  |LMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMR|   R = Right edge
  |LMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMR|   L = Left edge
  |LMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMR|   M = Middle pos.
  |cBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBd|
  +-------------------+

When a bishop finds himself in one of these positions, we'll define his
adjusted movement, if necessary, as follows:

  +-----+------+---------+----------+--------+
  | Pos | Bits | Heading | Adjusted | Offset |
  +-----+------+---------+----------+--------+
  |  a  |  00  |   NW    | no move  |    0   |
  |     |  01  |   NE    |    E     |   +1   |
  |     |  10  |   SW    |    S     |   +19  |
  |     |  11  |   SE    |    SE    |   +20  |
  +-----+------+---------+----------+--------+

  |     |  10  |   SW    |    W     |   -1   |
  |     |  11  |   SE    | no move  |    0   |
  +-----+------+---------+----------+--------+
  |  T  |  00  |   NW    |    W     |   -1   |
  |     |  01  |   NE    |    E     |   +1   |
  |     |  10  |   SW    |    SW    |   +18  |

  |     |  10  |   SW    |    W     |   -1   |
  |     |  11  |   SE    |    E     |   +1   |
  +-----+------+---------+----------+--------+
  |  R  |  00  |   NW    |    NW    |   -20  |
  |     |  01  |   NE    |    N     |   -19  |
  |     |  10  |   SW    |    SW    |   +18  |
  |     |  11  |   SE    |    S     |   +19  |
  +-----+------+---------+----------+--------+
